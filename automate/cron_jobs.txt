crontab -e	opens the crontab to edit times and log locations.
* * * * * >>> min | hour(24hr) | day/month | month | day/week (0=sunday)
*s that aren’t set are read as ‘every’ by the cronjob. 

These are the current crontab tasks:
0 2 * * 0,3 /home/newbee/automate/weekly.sh >> /home/newbee/automate/weekly.log 2>&1
0 3 * * * /home/newbee/automate/daily.sh >> /home/newbee/automate/daily.log 2>&1

The cron jobs fire a bash script that enters the venv and fires the python script for daily or weekly scrapes.

Log files are created in the “automation” directory, they’re all the terminal prints from the python scripts.


Connecting the droplet DB to the frontend:

.evn on frontend:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://newbee:your_actual_password@137.184.34.110/job_crawler

File adjustments on backend:
I changed the postgresql.conf file to listen for all IP address requests.
listen_addresses '*' 

Then adjusted the pg_hba.conf to actually allow the connection from my home computer’s IP. 
host	 all 	all 	my_ip/32 	md5

To allow access for the front end, we’ll need to adjust the pg_hba.conf to allow access to the FE’s IP address.
