They use our platform to do things like manage payment workflows and monitor their business. As an engineer, you will work with our product team to build products and features for these users.ABOUT MODERN TREASURYModern Treasury is the operating system for money movement.

By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.The RoleSoftware Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.Core ResponsibilitiesAs a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.SWE principles include: Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.Technologies We UseIt doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly.

Unfamiliar with the integration problem? The average company expects to spend hundreds of hours a year integrating with dozens or more vendors. Alignment between sales, partnerships, product management, design, engineering, and customer success (a lot, right?) is absolutely critical — and a major headache. Integrations are a to-do that goes on and on. Our Unified API empowers developers to offer integrations with hundreds of platforms instantly. Now we’re hiring for you: an ambitious leader ready to help build, design, and support enterprise-grade software scaled to millions of users. Are you ready to be part of a team redefining how companies build for the future? Apply now!   We are looking to grow our Partner Engineering team to help extend our reach across 7 categories in new and unprecedented ways!   Partner Engineering is an essential part of Merge's Platform team. This is a high visibility, high ownership role that plays a crucial part in Merge’s mission of powering integrations for all B2B companies. This role would appeal to someone who loves coding and thinking through complex scenarios, just as much as communicating with a variety of stakeholders, both technical and non-technical.   Responsibilities   Own the technical strategy and execution lifecycle of integrations with our API providers --- ideation, development, launch, and beyond. Work cross-functionally with partnerships, engineering, post-sales, product to deliver enterprise-grade integrations & expand Merge's coverage across 7 categories Internally advocate for Partner Engineering needs, and lead projects related to data quality and internal tooling Help design the Partner Engineering function at Merge -- what it's responsible for, how it interfaces with other teams, and how it'll grow and develop over time.     Experience   2+ years in an engineering role, preferably at a startup Strong technical understanding and problem solving, preferably in the form of a prior Computer Science background or other engineering orientation. Prior experience with APIs and integrations is a plus Ability to manage responsibilities across different areas such as working cross functionally, debugging and building on APIs, or writing documentation. Bias to action & preference for being hands on -- Partner Engineers work on powering mission-critical integrations for our customers, so we’re not afraid to jump in and become owners! Strong communication skills, adept at interfacing with different audiences and communicating complex technical concepts     Compensation  The cash compensation range for this role is $125,000 - $150,000. Actual compensation packages are based on a wide array of factors unique to each candidate, including but not limited to skill set, years & depth of experience, certifications. In addition to cash compensation, all employees receive an equity compensation package.    Benefits   Unlimited PTO 100% covered health, vision, and dental insurance 401(k) plan Free dinner when working after 7pm   Merge is an equal opportunity employer, and we value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, disability status, or any other protected class.	{"apply": "True", "salary": "$125,000 - $150,000 /year", "summary": "Merge is seeking a Partner Engineer with 2+ years of experience in engineering, preferably at a startup.

Developers usually don’t do this out of malice, but simply because it's not trivial to get every detail of security-related functionality right, and developers aren’t always security experts.Our goal is to improve this by increasing developers’ knowledge of security best practices (e.g. in our technical blogs), but also by giving them the tools to easily find and fix security issues in their apps. This is done through our free app analysis tool AppSweep, but also through our open source releases. We are looking for a software engineer who is passionate about educating developers about security issues and increasing the security in iOS and Android applications. If making the app world a more secure place appeals to you, and topics like configurable program analysis, program slicing, method swizzling and dynamic instrumentation are something you’ve always wanted to work on every day, you’ll feel right at home with our team in Munich. In this position you will work on AppSweep, extend it to new technologies, improve its detection capabilities, and have the opportunity to add completely new features, all with the goal of supporting developers as much as possible in security topics. You will also be able to create new technically interesting blog posts about security issues in mobile applications. Depending on your preference and knowledge, new features will be implemented for  iOS app analysis using C++ and the LLVM compiler framework, or Android app analysis using Java and Java bytecode (e.g., extending our Open Source analysis library proguard-core).    Requirements  Master's degree in Computer Science, or similar practical experience. 5 years of industry experience or comparable Good modern C++ or Java skills. Strong interest in mobile security, e.g. from university courses or from CTFs. Interest in understanding how things work under the hood.    Useful skills  Experience with app development and build tools. Experience in low level programming, compiler technology and/or optimization techniques. Experience working with complex code bases. Experience with reverse engineering and the commonly used tools, for example Jadx, apktool, Radare, Ghidra, or IDApro.    Responsibilities  Publish technical blog posts about security issues. Research, test and implement new analysis techniques. Develop detection techniques for newly found issues in apps. Maintain and improve our existing code base. Support customers in the usage of our software.    What Guardsquare offers you  A team of like-minded colleagues all pulling in the same direction. A full time job with a competitive salary package. The tools & flexibility to develop yourself successfully. An international environment where you will interact with motivated & open colleagues with different backgrounds.

We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.The RoleForward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.Our PrinciplesImpact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter.Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves.Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge.Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers.What We ValueStrong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.Experience with logistics, materiel, sustainment, aviation, or readiness analysis is a plus.Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.Understanding of how technical decisions impact the user of what you’re building.Strong coder with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, or similar.Demonstrated ability to collaborate effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals, and comfortable working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.Demonstrated ability to continuously learn, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.Willingness and interest to travel as needed.RequirementsActive US Security clearance or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance.Our benefits aim to promote health and wellbeing across all areas of Palantirians’ lives.

WHAT WE DOWe’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software. We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more.

We’d love to partner on our journey to change the world of compensation!  Product Engineering @ Pave At the heart of every company’s compensation strategy are the following pillars: compensation bands, compensation planning, and total rewards communication. Creating and maintaining compensation bands in an ever-changing labor market is equal parts art and science. These bands are then utilized in various compensation planning strategies to reward high performers and retain top talent. Finally, the output of compensation planning is visualized for employees in their Total Rewards portals where they can continue to simulate how their wealth can grow through refresh programs, promotions, and company growth. Our Market Pricing and Plan & Execute teams build the products that enable our customers do so in a frictionless and transparent way.

Lumos is doing that, but for all the apps a company uses. In short, we are building a company’s AppHQ to manage all apps in one place. Here’s how it works: You go to the Lumos AppStore, request your app of choice, your manager approves the request in Slack and your account is created — instantly. No long IT ticket queues anymore. What if you stop using the app? Lumos automatically detects that and removes your license, saving the company money and improving security. In its essence, Lumos is creating the meta app for all apps. 🌟 Why You Should Join Lumos  🚀 Jump on a Rocketship: In less than two years, our team has grown from 20 to ~80 people and our customer base has 10x’ed with companies like GitHub, MongoDB and Major League Baseball! 📈 Trust Renowned Backers: Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) backed us since the beginning. Also, Prospect (a platform where startup people evaluate different companies) called Lumos a 10x company among just a few other companies, beating startups like Rippling, Retool or Zapier. ⭐ Thrive in a Unique Culture: You’ll be one of the first 100 people to join. So, you'll have actual influence on the trajectory of the company. Most importantly, when we talk about Lumos, we don’t just talk about the products we create but also the distinctive philosophy we live by. Check out our values to see if it’s a fit.  🌎 More Information on the Role In today's world, the web is where we find all our superpowers. We sketch out ideas on Figma, bring to life our projects on GitHub, and cultivate teamwork on Slack. At Lumos, our vision is to bundle all these tools securely in one place. We're pioneering the first-ever AppStore for Companies. 🪄 Here's how it works. Head over to the Lumos AppStore, select your required app (like AWS), opt for your permissions (such as Prod Admin access), and get approval for time-limited access via Slack. Once Lumos establishes your account and you've done your magic, it removes access when it's no longer required. So, we're saying goodbye to the never-ending IT ticket queues while ensuring the least privilege access and an efficient use of licenses. 🏆 Lumos has grown quite a bit recently, supported by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a dedicated team of almost 70, and a customer base that has swelled five-fold in the last year. We’re seeing very strong adoption with core products, and to double down our investment and support accelerating growth, we’re hiring a Senior Fullstack Engineer to join the team. You'd be among the first 100 employees, setting the foundation for extreme growth. 📈 About the role As a Foundations engineer, you will build mission-critical infrastructure to support the production systems. You will ensure the scalability and reliability of our production infrastructure. You will also create tools and frameworks for our CI/CD systems that enable entire engineering to ship production-quality code with high velocity. ✨ Your Responsibilities  Solve challenges in scaling infrastructure for a fast growing engineering team/ Design reliable and scalable infrastructure to allow product engineering to deploy services with ease Contribute to the technical direction of Foundations vision by outlining initiatives, creating and reviewing technical design docs Set the standard by incorporating best practices and guidelines for building tools and infrastructure Work closely with product engineering to identify and remove bottlenecks/pain-points which slow down our releases. Create tools and environments to provide an A+ developer experience for engineering.  🙌 What We Value We purposefully did not create a standard list of minimum qualifications because we care much more about your motivation, excitement, and potential to grow into the role than about your CV. Instead of focusing on what people need to have, we focus on what people need to do. Additionally, we try to find out whether you would be a good fit for Lumos based on our values that define how we achieve outcomes and what characteristics we value. *We encourage you to apply even if you think you might not be perfect fit! 🤝 Thank you for considering Lumos! 🎉  💸 Benefits and Perks:  💯 Remote work culture (+/-4 hours Pacific Time) ⛑ Medical, Vision, & Dental coverage covered by Lumos 🛩 Company and team bonding trips throughout the year fully covered by Lumos 💻 Optimal WFH setup to set you up for success 🌴 Unlimited PTO, with minimum time off to make sure you are rested and able to be at your best 👶🏽 Up to (4) months off for both the Birthing & Non-birthing parent 💰 Wellness stipend to keep you awesome and healthy 🏦 401k contribution plan  Thank you for considering us - we're flattered! 😃 🎉	{"apply": "True", "salary": "See application for details.", "summary": "Lumos is a rapidly growing company aiming to create a central AppHQ for businesses, streamlining app management and access.

You will serve as our guardian, ensuring our platforms are resilient against all threats while meeting compliance requirements. We value a hands-on approach and seek someone who is conversant with the nitty-gritty of security frameworks, while being deeply engaged in strategic and operational security endeavors.WHAT YOU’LL DO - Implement & Navigate Security Rituals: Understand, oversee, and drive the rituals associated with SOC2, remain abreast with HIPAA, and ensure that we remain compliant and informed. - Handle Customer Queries: Serve as the primary point of contact for all customer security inquiries, ensuring their concerns and queries are addressed promptly and comprehensively. - Audit & Oversight: Regularly audit our platforms and tech stack, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed in a timely manner. - Manage Third-party Relationships: Coordinate with vendors for penetration testing and other security services, ensuring that our platforms undergo regular scrutiny and remain fortified. - Collaborate with Engineering Team: Work closely with the engineering department during feature planning and roll-out, ensuring security remains at the forefront of all initiatives. - Audit Internal Systems: While you won't directly write the terraform, you will need to read, audit, and provide feedback on internal private networks, IT systems, and more.WHO YOU ARE - You have 4+ years of experience in the security domain, with a proven track record of hands-on involvement in complex projects. - Your expertise isn't just theoretical. You know how to "talk the talk", especially when it comes to the rituals and routines of security compliance. - With strong knowledge of HIPAA, you're no stranger to the delicate information we handle. - You are adaptable and flexible, always ready to engage with security challenges at both enterprise and client levels. - While you may not write the code, you possess the ability to read, understand, and audit systems, networks, and IT setups to ensure airtight security.WHAT WE DOWe’re fixing one of the most broken and costly pieces of the US healthcare system: medical billing.Today, healthcare providers spend over $250B each year on administrative overhead just to get paid by insurance. Medical billing is expensive because it’s nuanced and hard - maybe ~100x harder than credit card payment processing - and because it’s traditionally done by armies of humans who track and manage complex rules and processes specific to individual insurance companies with little or no supporting software. We’re rethinking medical billing from the ground up, building software backed by best-in-class data science (and, soon, a dash of machine learning) to automate much of this complexity so healthcare providers can get paid dramatically more easily and inexpensively.We were in the Y Combinator W20 batch and have since been well funded by a world-class group of funds (8VC, First Round Capital, BoxGroup) + angel investors. We're now helping our customers treat opioid addiction, provide holistic care for women, lose weight, increase access to mental health care, and much more. This is such important and gratifying work; we can't wait for you to join our team and help support some of the most important innovation happening in healthcare today!OUR VALUESWe spend at least as much time with our coworkers as we do with our closest friends + family - if we intend to do the most important + challenging work of our lives, it’s important that these folks energize us, support us, inspire us, and push us to do our best work. This is what you can expect of your teammates at Candid (in no particular order): - We put our customers first - We take care of each other and ourselves - We anchor on outcomes and work relentlessly and creatively to achieve them - We collectively prioritize building a diverse and inclusive workspace - We believe humility is our greatest strength - We are candid, kind, and committed - We strive to be the most prepared person in the room - We are truth seekersPAY TRANSPARENCYThe estimated starting annual salary range for this position is $140,000 - $190,000 USD.

At Pave, our vision is simple - Make Compensation Fair.  How are we going to get there? By building the most intelligent compensation platform, powered by the largest real-time compensation dataset on earth. We partner with our customers to help them build and retain world-class teams through planning, communicating and benchmarking their team’s compensation in real time.  And you don’t have to just hear it from us — you can hear it from our customers: Hover, Sweetgreen, Airtable and more. We’re growing fast, building an incredible team and product, and having plenty of fun as we do it in our San Francisco and New York City offices.  If stretching the rubber band, building with intellectual honesty and focusing on impact sounds exciting - we highly encourage you to reach out. We’d love to partner on our journey to change the world of compensation!  Product Engineering @ Pave At the heart of every company’s compensation strategy are the following pillars: compensation bands, compensation planning, and total rewards communication. Creating and maintaining compensation bands in an ever-changing labor market is equal parts art and science. These bands are then utilized in various compensation planning strategies to reward high performers and retain top talent. Finally, the output of compensation planning is visualized for employees in their Total Rewards portals where they can continue to simulate how their wealth can grow through refresh programs, promotions, and company growth. Our Market Pricing and Plan & Execute teams build the products that enable our customers do so in a frictionless and transparent way. Over the next year, we have an ambitious roadmap that encompass the entire compensation strategy lifecycle: how customers define their compensation philosophies, model their jobs in Pave, understand trends in market data, translate trends into their compensation bands, apply band adjustments into merit cycle planning, communicate compensation adjustments to eligible employees, and help employees understand the value of their compensation over time. Within our agile teams, we value strong ownership and collaboration. Team members move between ideation, scoping, and execution in a matter of days while closely iterating with cross functional partners on requirements.

The prospect of being able to prototype to test ideas out before committing to building is exciting to you. Nice to have: experience working at B2B SaaS tech companies, especially during hypergrowth  Compensation, It's What We Do.This salary range may include multiple levels.
