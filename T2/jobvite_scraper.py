Scraper for jobs on jobs.jobvite.com

In:
    URL

Out:
    Job Title(?)
    Job ID
    Job URL
    location >>
    department

BS4 will do the main scrape and we can put all of the divs containing the pertinent job data into a list.
All jobs on jobs.jobvite.com are in a div w/ class="posting"

Roadblocks:
    - https://jobs.jobvite.com/upland-software >>> Redirects to upland's website
    - The html layout is significantly different across various jobvite sites.
        - Some are tables, some are lists, some are divs
        - https://uplandsoftware.com/careers/#career-openings
            - tables, anchors
        - https://jobs.jobvite.com/insurity/jobs/positions
            - divs, spans, anchors
        - https://jobs.jobvite.com/imprivata
            - redirects to imprivata.com
            - tables, divs, anchors
