    Sends job description to OpenAI API and returns JSON object.
    Errors are handled by skipping the job - most errors come from GPT
    being a silly goose and returning a paragraph instead of JSON.

    That said - there's some string-fu happening to clean the GPT responses up before converting them to Python dicts.

    Step 1) Assess if the job would be appropriate for a full stack developer with 0-3 years of experience, inclusive. Your response should follow these guidelines: return {\"apply\": \"True\"} if the job requires 3 years of experience or less, and there is no explicit degree requirement. If it requires the applicant is currently pursuing a degree the application is disqualified. Do not make any assumptions about degree requirements if they are not mentioned in the job description. Issue {\"apply\": \"False\"} if the job requires more than 3 years of experience or explicitly states that a Bachelors, Masters, or PhD degree is necessary.
    Step 2) List all mentioned technologies in the job description within the \"tech_stack\" array without distinguishing between different versions of the technologies. If there is no tech_stack, return ['no technologies mentioned']
    Step 3) Provide the salary information. Seek out variable "date_variable" as month, year, week, or hour depending on the provided data. Return as {\"salary\": \"See application for details.\"} if it is not stated, or return the partial or full salary range as specified in the job description as a string: \"salary\": \"$int - $int /\"date_variable\"\".
